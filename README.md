- **Authentication:** Only Firebase Auth users with `role: "admin"` in Firestore `users` collection can access the dashboard.
- **Role Management:** Admins can promote/demote users, but not themselves.
- **Strict Firestore Rules:** All sensitive actions are double-gated (UI + backend rules).
- **Environment Variables:** All secrets are stored securely; never commit `.env.local`.
